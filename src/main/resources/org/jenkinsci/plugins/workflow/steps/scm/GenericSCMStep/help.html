    This is a special step that allows to run checkouts using any configuration
    options offered by any Pipeline-compatible SCM plugin.
    To use a concrete SCM implementations, just install the corresponding plugin 
    and check if it is shown in the list below.
    Then select the SCM to use from the dropdown list and configure it as needed.
    </p>
    <p>This step returns a <code>Map</code> of any variables the SCM plugin would
    set in a Freestyle job, so if your SCM is git, you can do:
    </p>
    <pre>
        def scmVars = checkout scm
        def commitHash = scmVars.GIT_COMMIT

        // or

        def commitHash = checkout(scm).GIT_COMMIT
    </pre>
    <p>
    Any other specific step to run checkouts (like <code>svn</code> or <code>git</code>)
    are simplistic options of this step.
