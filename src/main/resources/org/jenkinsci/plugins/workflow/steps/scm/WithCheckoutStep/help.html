        This step allows checking out any Pipeline-compatible SCM, with any
        environment variables set by that SCM made available within the block.
        To use a concrete SCM implementation, just install the corresponding plugin
        and check if it is shown in the list below.
        Then select the SCM to use from the dropdown list and configure it as needed.
    </p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <pre>
        node {
            withCheckout(scm) {
                echo "GIT_COMMIT is ${env.GIT_COMMIT}"
            }
        }
    </pre>
    <p>
        Note that if multiple <code>withCheckout</code> invocations are nested within
        each other, only the closest parent invocation's environment variables will be
        available within that body.
    </p>
